# EDA_Project
Analysis of the Reverse Osmosis Data in  Chemical Engineering.   

Explore my collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects, where I analyze diverse datasets, create visualizations, and derive insights. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis and visualization. Dive into individual project folders for detailed code, visualizations, and key findings.

# Python library used

5. Perform Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

# Project Details
1. Data Cleaning: The initial step involves cleaning up the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Data Analysis: The focus of the analysis is on marathon races that took place in the USA in the year 2020. Various aspects of the race data are explored, including participant demographics, race distances, race locations, and race timings.
3. Visualization: The insights derived from the data analysis are visually represented using Seaborn and other visualization libraries. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
4. ML Algorithm: applying machine learning algorithm to find certain trends and relationships between data and easy visualization.
   
Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of key insights and observations obtained from the EDA process & machine learning algorithm.
